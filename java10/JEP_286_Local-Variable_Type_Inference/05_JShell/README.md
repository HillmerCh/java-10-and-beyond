This example covers the use of `Type Inference` in JShell to declare variables using them in Expressions, Statements, and Blocks as Loops.

You can run this example on your local JShell or online. For more information about JShell you can go to:  https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jdk9-jigsaw/tree/master/session-3-jshell

To execute Local JShell run next command

     jshell

Once you are on JShell, try to do next exercises using Variable Type Inference

- Make a sum of two number of the type int, and print the result
- Declare text using String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
- Declare collections as List, ArrayList, Set, Map

For Object type you can use the method getClass() to check the type that the compiler used.
