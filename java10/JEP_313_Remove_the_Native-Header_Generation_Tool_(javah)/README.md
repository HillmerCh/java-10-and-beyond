### JEP 313: Remove the Native-Header Generation Tool (javah)

Where to look for the absence of `javah`:

```bash
ls ???????
```

Hint: where is JAVA_HOME pointing?

Have you been able to locate the `javah` command in the lists?

How do you generate headers now? 

```bash
jav?? ?? . NativeTest.java  
```

What do the ?? stand for? What does the compiler produce in the current directory. 

Check contents of the file by doing: 

```bash
cat NativeTest.h
```

Does the header file should contain information related to header information?
